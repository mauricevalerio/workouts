## Reflection

### Backend
Building the routes, controllers, models, and connecting to the MongoDB Database Atlas in the backend is pretty straightforward and can be automated by creating a template of some kind. The only hard part in the backend section is the authentication part wherein you have you figure out each scenario to apply the authentication.

### Frontend
Everything appears to be also pretty straightforward on the frontend such as the React Router, custom hooks, context API, useState, and useEffect. I only struggled with the useReducer hook which appears to be a more advanced topic in React to handle complex states and I just need more practice to be more familiar with it as there's a lot of moving parts on the said hook.

## Future Improvements
  - Axios can be integrated on the API calls to shorten the code.
  - The use of the Data Layer API and Form component which is part of React Router appears to be beneficial in this project also to eliminate creating custom hooks, useState, and useEffect to make the code cleaner.
